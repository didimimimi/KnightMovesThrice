# KnightMovesThrice
A small project where a knight has to reach, from a starting point on a chessboard, the desired position in 3 moves or less

Using a BFS algorithm, a knight on a chessboard tries to move around in a way that will allow it to reach the desired position using, at maximum, three moves.

The user selects two positions on the chessboards, one for the knight and one for its goal position. If a solution is possible, the knight will move to the location, showing its moves on the way.
